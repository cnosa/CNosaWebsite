## About Me

Mathematician with strong academic background and expertise in applying mathematical and computational tools to real-world problems. My experience includes mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and programming, developed through academic research and undergraduate mathematics instruction. I thrive on new challenges, adapt quickly to diverse environments, and am committed to continuous learning. I particularly enjoy collaborative work in multidisciplinary teams where I can contribute analytical thinking and rigorous problem-solving approaches. Currently, I am actively seeking new professional opportunities where I can apply and expand my expertise.
