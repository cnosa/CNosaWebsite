*Let’s talk about purpose.  
Let’s talk about people.  
Let’s talk about **what’s possible** when curiosity has a cause.*

I am a mathematician. But before that, I am someone who cares deeply about systems—how they emerge, evolve, and impact the lives of those inside them. I’ve always been drawn to structure, not for its own sake, but for the clarity and power it brings to messy, complex realities.

Throughout my academic path, I’ve focused on the intersection between abstract theory and practical application. Whether it’s through simulations, algorithmic thinking, or teaching others to see patterns where there once was noise, my work has always aimed to translate curiosity into something usable, shareable, and meaningful.

I believe mathematics is not just a discipline—it’s a stance toward the world. One that values coherence, transparency, and rigor. But most of all, one that assumes responsibility: for how knowledge is produced, and for what it enables.

Now, I seek to grow this philosophy in new contexts—collaborating across disciplines, building tools that serve real needs, and staying grounded in the people my work might affect. I want to be part of a space where ideas are tested, refined, and ultimately used. That’s the kind of purpose I’m committed to.
